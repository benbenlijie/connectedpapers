# Fixes Applied to fetch-paper-details Function

## Problem
The Edge Function was encountering JSON parsing errors when trying to fetch paper details from OpenAlex:
```
Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

This error occurs because the OpenAlex API was returning HTML instead of JSON, indicating that the API calls were malformed.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `fetchFromOpenAlex` function where:
1. OpenAlex URLs were being used directly instead of being converted to proper API endpoints
2. Insufficient error handling for non-JSON responses
3. Missing fallback mechanisms when OpenAlex API fails

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved OpenAlex URL Handling
- **Location**: Lines 88-118 in `/workspace/supabase/functions/fetch-paper-details/index.ts`
- **Change**: Added proper URL conversion logic to transform OpenAlex URLs into API endpoints:
  - `https://openalex.org/W123456` â†’ `https://api.openalex.org/works/W123456`
  - Added detection for different OpenAlex ID formats
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms when OpenAlex API fails

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in fetchFromOpenAlex
- **Location**: Lines 204-250 in the same file  
- **Changes**:
  - Added Content-Type validation to ensure JSON responses
  - Added detailed logging for debugging
  - Added proper error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Added Accept header to explicitly request JSON

### 3. Response Validation and Search API Support
- **Location**: Lines 160-170 in the same file
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation for API response structure
  - Added support for Semantic Scholar search API responses
  - Added proper handling when search returns empty results

### 4. Improved Fallback Strategy
- **Location**: Lines 119-135 in the same file
- **Changes**:
  - Added title-based search when DOI is unavailable
  - Added work ID extraction from URLs as fallback
  - Added graceful degradation when OpenAlex completely fails

## Key Technical Improvements

1. **URL Normalization**: Properly converts all OpenAlex URL formats to API endpoints
2. **Content-Type Validation**: Prevents JSON parsing of HTML responses
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Function continues working even if OpenAlex is unavailable
4. **Better Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for easier debugging
5. **Multiple Fallbacks**: Several strategies to find papers even when primary method fails

## Testing Recommendations

To test these fixes:
1. Try with different OpenAlex URL formats:
   - `https://openalex.org/W2741809807`
   - `W2741809807`
   - Malformed URLs to test fallbacks

2. Monitor logs for:
   - Successful API conversions
   - Fallback activations
   - Error handling effectiveness

## Deployment

The function can be deployed using:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy fetch-paper-details
```

Note: Ensure proper Supabase authentication is configured before deployment.
