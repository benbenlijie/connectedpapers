# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Upstream politeness floors**: `bun run check:politeness` (and the CI server job) asserts that the default spacing in `server/config.ts` stays at or above each upstream's published floor (arXiv API 3 s, arXiv content 1 s project policy, S2 anonymous/keyed, OpenAlex), with source URLs in the script.

- **`ABSTRACT_MEMO_MAX`**: the in-memory CC0 abstract memo used when `PAPER_CONTENT_MODE=off` is configurable (default 500); oldest entries are evicted when the cap is hit. `0` disables the memo; a non-numeric value falls back to 500.

- **Resizable panels**: the home view's paper list, network graph, and details panel (plus
  the two graphs in comparison split view) and the reader's table of contents, article,
  and AI assistant panels can now be dragged to any width. Sizes are saved per layout in
  `localStorage` and restored on the next visit; dividers are also keyboard operable
  (focus one and press the arrow keys).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

This is the first tagged release. It covers the whole project to date, so the entries
below describe capabilities rather than a diff against a previous tag.

### Added

- **Paper search** across Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex in parallel, with duplicate
  merging, relevance ranking, and lookup of a single paper by DOI, arXiv id, OpenAlex
  work id, or Semantic Scholar id. Local, reusable keyword history.
- **Interactive citation-network graph** built by a breadth-first crawl of references
  and citations, with PageRank influence, node/neighbour highlighting, and a
  renderer that uses `react-force-graph` (2D canvas by default, lazily loaded
  three.js 3D view).
- **Graph analysis and navigation**: Louvain community detection with cluster
  colouring, clickable edge-type toggles, a draggable/playable timeline that limits the
  graph to a selected year, encoding by cluster/year/field/citations/PageRank, a
  minimap, lazy relevance-prioritized node expansion, and a node context menu (rebuild
  from node, search by title, expand, add to comparison, open the source).
- **Multi-source related edges**: Semantic Scholar recommendations, OpenAlex related
  works (with an arXiv-title fallback), bibliographic coupling, and SPECTER2 semantic
  nearest neighbours, deduplicated by canonical DOI/arXiv identity.
- **Research lineage**: a paper's direct predecessors (references) and successors
  (citations), ranked by influence, citation count, and recency, without a full graph
  crawl (`POST /api/lineage`).
- **"How are two papers related?"** (`POST /api/connect`): finds connection paths
  through stored relations, expands online when needed, and falls back to semantic
  similarity, returning ranked paths with an explanation for each hop.
- **Shareable deep links**: the selected paper, filters, encoding, and view state sync
  to the address bar, so a shared URL or a refresh restores the view.
- **Export**: PNG and JSON for the visible graph, BibTeX and CSV for the visible
  nodes, plus a full fetched-network JSON export.
- **Local-first knowledge management**: per-paper notes with graph markers, favourites,
  collections, saved searches, a reading queue with progress tracking, and reader
  highlights with colour-coded annotations — all persisted in the browser.
- **Dual-paper comparison**: two side-by-side citation graphs that share filters and
  encoding while keeping independent selection and highlighting.
- **In-app arXiv reader** at `/read/:arxivId`: full-text HTML with a section outline
  and figures, plus an arXiv abs/PDF fallback for papers with no HTML build.
- **Immersive bilingual translation** in the reader: paragraph-level translation below
  each source paragraph, collapsible per paragraph, backed by configurable LLM
  providers (any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint, or the browser's built-in
  Translator API) with automatic fallback, caching, and viewport-driven lazy work.
- **AI reading assistant**: a per-paper, multi-turn chat panel driven by a local
  `opencode serve` agent. Answers are grounded in the paper itself via retrieval tools
  (`paper_search` / `paper_section`) instead of model memory, streamed over SSE with
  visible tool activity.
- **Self-hosted single-process backend**: Bun + `bun:sqlite` (`data/app.db`), static
  hosting of the built frontend, SPA fallback, and an in-process async job queue with a
  materialized network cache.
- **Optional public-deployment gate**: an `ACCESS_TOKEN` gate for all requests with a
  constant-time comparison and `?token=` → HttpOnly cookie flow, per-IP rate limiting
  (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`, `TRUST_PROXY`), sub-path mounting via `VITE_BASE`, and a
  one-command deploy script with a deployment guide.
- **Configurable upstream access**: optional `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` and
  `OPENALEX_API_KEY`, per-source minimum request intervals, and retry with backoff.
- **Test suite and CI**: `bun test` for the backend, Vitest for the frontend, plus
  typecheck/lint/build, run by a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed

- Graph rendering moved from a hand-written Canvas 2D renderer with a custom
  WebWorker `d3-force` layout to `react-force-graph`, keeping the 3D three.js bundle
  code-split and out of the initial load.
- Translation in the reader became cached, lazy, and viewport-driven, with progressive
  output and reversible paragraph folds.
- The reader's AI assistant moved to the `opencode` agent harness with token-guarded
  paper-retrieval routes, so answers cite the paper's own sections.
- Upstream clients now rate-limit per source and support OpenAlex API keys instead of
  relying only on anonymous shared quotas.

### Fixed

- Search results are ranked by relevance rather than raw citation count.
- The graph timeline keeps a stable range while filters change.
- Deep links rebuild the complete graph, including when opened from a shared URL.
- Reader correctness: papers without an arXiv HTML build are readable, finished
  translations stay selectable, and translated text can be highlighted like the source.
- Library papers are keyed consistently between the list and the details panel.
- The server exits cleanly on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, and the Bun `idleTimeout` was raised so
  AI SSE streams are not cut off at 10 seconds.
- The deploy script finds Bun on the remote host when it is not on `PATH`.
- The 3D graph view shows node titles.
- Rate limiting can no longer be bypassed by forging a client address: the limiter keyed
  on the _left-most_ `X-Forwarded-For` entry, so behind a proxy that appends to that
  header a visitor could pick — and rotate — their own bucket. The client address now
  prefers `X-Real-IP` and otherwise reads the right-most forwarded entry, and the bundled
  nginx configs overwrite the header with `$remote_addr` instead of appending.
- `scripts/setup.sh` installs the backend's root dependency (`unpdf`), which it had
  skipped, so the documented three-command quick start no longer produces a server that
  fails on PDF text extraction.
