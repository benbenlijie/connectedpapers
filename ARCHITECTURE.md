# Architecture

## Purpose & constraints

A local, single-user tool for exploring academic citation networks. Given a paper
(DOI, arXiv id, OpenAlex work id, or Semantic Scholar id), it fetches metadata,
crawls references/citations breadth-first, and renders an interactive graph.

Hard constraints that shape every decision below:

- **Single user, local only.** No authentication, no multi-tenancy, no user table.
- **Bound to loopback.** `server/main.ts` serves on `127.0.0.1:8787` by default
  (`server/env.ts`: `HOST` / `PORT`, default `127.0.0.1` / `8787`).
- **One process, one SQLite file.** `server/db.ts` opens `data/app.db` via
  `bun:sqlite`, sets `journal_mode=WAL` and `foreign_keys=ON`, applies
  `server/schema.sql` on boot.
- **Upstream is best-effort.** Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex are rate-limited;
  failures degrade (retry, partial results) rather than aborting the app.

  AI sidecar:
    server/opencode.ts spawns `opencode serve` (cwd data/opencode-runtime/,
    XDG_* isolated); its tools call back to /api/paper/session/* with
    X-Internal-Token; /api/ai/* proxies prompts + the /event SSE stream.

 Frontend state split:
   React Query  → server state (search results, details, network)
   Zustand      → UI state only (selection, highlight, filters)
```

`server/main.ts` is the only transport layer: it parses the URL, dispatches the
`/api/*` routes, falls back to static files for everything else (rejecting
`..` paths), and funnels thrown `ApiError`s through `handleError`.

## Key design decisions

### 1. Async job + polling for network builds

Building a citation network can take tens of seconds (BFS across batches with
delays, capped by `config.crawl.maxExecutionMs`, default 45s). A blocking HTTP
request would be fragile, so `POST /api/network` returns either a cached graph
(`{ data, cached: true, status: 'done' }`) or `202 { job_id, status: 'pending' }`.
The client (`services/api.ts:networkWithPolling`) then polls `GET /api/jobs/:id`
every 1.5s up to a 180s deadline. Jobs live in the `jobs` table; `runJob` in
`jobs.ts` advances `pending → running → done|failed` and writes progress. On boot,
`recoverJobs()` resets interrupted `running` jobs to `pending` and resumes them,
so a crash mid-crawl does not strand work.

### 2. Cache key `queryHash(s2Path, depth, maxNodes, graphVersion)`

`db-queries.ts:queryHash` hashes `${rootId}_${depth}_${maxNodes}_v${graphVersion}`
with SHA-256 (first 32 hex chars). The hash is computed once at enqueue time from
the **resolved S2 path** (via `resolvePaperId`), stored in the job payload as
`query_hash`, and reused verbatim by `runJob` when writing the cache
(`jobs.ts:66` comment: "reuse the hash computed at enqueue; do not recompute from
`root.paperId`"). This guarantees the read key and write key are identical even if
the upstream canonical id changes shape. `graphVersion` (bump in `config.ts`)
invalidates every cached network when the graph algorithm changes. Cached rows in
`paper_networks` carry `expires_at` honored by `getCachedNetwork`.

### 3. Foreign-key ordering via `ensurePaperStub`

`citations.citing_paper_id` / `cited_paper_id` and `paper_authors.paper_id`
reference `papers(id)`. During a crawl, an edge may point at a paper not yet
fetched. `papers.ts:ensurePaperStub` inserts a minimal `(id, title=id)` row before
`upsertCitation`, so FK enforcement never fails; the full row is filled in later by
`upsertPaper` when the batch fetch returns.

### 4. PageRank dangling-mass conservation

`graph.ts:pagerank` runs 20 iterations at damping 0.85 and distributes rank to
out-edges **proportionally to their weight** (`weight` defaults to 1; coupling
edges are treated as symmetric and flow both ways). Mass that would leave the
node set — dangling nodes (`damping * rank`) or edges pointing outside the
rendered set (their damped share) — is accumulated in `lost` and redistributed
uniformly, so the rank vector always sums to 1. Node visual size is derived from
the resulting `pageRankScore`, and `connectedComponents` assigns `clusterId`s for
grouping.

### 5. OpenAlex → DOI resolution

OpenAlex-only ids (`W\d+`) are not valid Semantic Scholar lookup keys.
`resolve.ts:toS2Input` detects `kind === 'openalex'`, calls
`openalex.ts:getWorkByOpenAlexId`, and rewrites to `DOI:<doi>` (or `ARXIV:<id>`),
raising `PAPER_FETCH_FAILED` if the work has no DOI/arXiv id. All other id kinds
pass through `resolvePaperId(...).s2Path` unchanged.

### 6. Deep-link URL state

`graph/urlState.ts` is a pure codec: `serializeUrlState` writes the view state to
a query string with defaults omitted, and `parseUrlState` reads it back leniently
(clamping `depth` to 1–3 and `maxNodes` to 1–300, ignoring invalid values).
`hooks/useUrlSync.ts` runs two effects: URL → store on mount and on popstate, and
store → URL via a `useUiStore.subscribe` listener. A `lastWritten` ref holds the
last query string the hook wrote, so the read effect skips re-hydrating its own
navigation (breaking the feedback loop), and a `hydrated` ref prevents the first
default-state write from clobbering an incoming link. Root-paper changes push a
history entry while filter/encoding changes replace, so the browser back button
steps between papers but not between slider frames.

The URL carries the resolved root id plus the explicit `depth`/`maxNodes`, so the
same link rebuilds the same cached network regardless of `usePaperNetwork`'s
adaptive defaults. Lazily-expanded node ids ride along as repeated `e` (primary)
and `e2` (compare) params; `NetworkGraph` re-fetches each on load, so a shared
link restores the expanded subgraphs too. On load the hook installs a minimal `paperStubFromId(id)` so
`DetailsPanel`'s existing `usePaperDetails` call fills in the full record.
`selectRootPaper` (used by list clicks and double-click rebuild) clears the
explicit network params so a freshly chosen paper gets adaptive defaults again.

### 7. Graph export (PNG / JSON)

`graph/exportGraph.ts` separates the testable parts (`sanitizeFilename`,
`exportFilename`, `buildExportPayload`, `toBibtex`, `toCsv`) from two thin DOM
helpers (`downloadText`, `downloadCanvasPng`). The toolbar's export menu offers PNG
of the current view, JSON of the current (filtered) view, JSON of the full fetched
network, and BibTeX/CSV of the visible nodes; the JSON payload carries a `meta`
block (`scope`, `root_title`, counts, timestamp). PNG is captured from the single
`<canvas>` inside the graph container, so overlays (toolbar, legend, minimap) are
intentionally excluded. The 3D renderer is created with
`rendererConfig: { preserveDrawingBuffer: true }`; without it a WebGL `toDataURL`
returns a blank image.

### 8. Local paper notes

`lib/notes.ts` holds the pure note-map operations; `store/useNotesStore.ts` wraps
them over `localStorage['connectedpapers.notes.v1']` (lenient parse, guarded
writes). `DetailsPanel` edits the note for
`selectedNodeId || resolveClientId(selectedPaper)` on every keystroke and shows a
saved hint; `NetworkGraph` derives `annotatedIds` from the store and marks those
nodes in the 2D canvas pass. Notes are deliberately local-only: not in the URL,
not exported, and not marked in 3D.

### 9. Dual-paper comparison

`useUiStore` gains a second root slot (`comparePaper`) and its own node selection
(`compareSelectedNodeId`). `NetworkGraph` is parameterized with
`{ paper?, slot?: 'primary' | 'compare' }`: the pane derives its selection id from
the slot and a slot-aware setter that clears the *other* slot's selection, so the
details panel follows whichever pane was clicked last. Filters, encodings, view
mode and timeline stay shared through the store; only the toolbar/legend/timeline
render on the primary pane (the compare pane keeps its own export menu via a
`placement` prop on `GraphToolbar`). Each pane runs its own
`usePaperNetwork(rootPaper)`, so React Query caches the two networks
independently. `PaperList` toggles B with a per-row button, and the URL adds
`paper2`/`node2`; a history entry is pushed when either root changes.

### 10. Configurable LLM providers and translation

`LLM_PROVIDERS` (a JSON array in `server/.env`, order = priority) lists
OpenAI-compatible endpoints and browser-built-in translators. `llm.ts:chat`
POSTs `{baseUrl}/chat/completions` with a Bearer key when present and an
`AbortController` timeout; `routes/translate.ts` serves
`translations`-table cache hits, batches the rest into one call, and parses a
length-checked JSON array (`translate.ts`). Keys stay server-side. Provider
fallback lives on the client: it walks the `/api/llm/status` order, handles
`kind: "browser"` locally, and posts `/api/translate` with an explicit provider
for `kind: "openai"` entries, advancing on failure. The cache key is
`hash(target|source)` so results are reused across providers.

### 11. In-app arXiv HTML reader

`/read/:arxivId` renders the paper's arXiv HTML (ar5iv/LaTeXML) instead of the
PDF: structured paragraphs make translation and AI annotation tractable, and
arxiv.org serves it with `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so no proxy is needed.
`lib/article.ts` sanitizes third-party HTML (drops `script`/`iframe`/`object`/
`embed`/`noscript`, strips `on*` handlers and `javascript:` URLs, injects
`<base href="https://arxiv.org/">`) and extracts an outline. LaTeXML puts the
anchor id on the enclosing `<section>`, not the heading, so `extractOutline`
handles both. The sanitized document is rendered in an
`<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin">` (no `allow-scripts`), which blocks script
execution while letting the parent read the DOM for outline jumps today and
translation injection later. `normalizeS2Paper` now exposes `arxiv_id`
(`externalIds.ArXiv`); the details panel links to the reader when present, and
the page falls back to arXiv abs/PDF links when no HTML build exists.

### 12. Immersive paragraph translation

`lib/readerBlocks.ts` collects text-bearing blocks from the reader's
`contentDocument` (skipping nested, numeric-only, already-CJK, and already-
translated nodes) and inserts a `data-cn-translation` block after each source
block (inside table cells). `blockSourceText` reads a cleaned clone (drops
MathML `<annotation>` so formulas are not duplicated, drops inserted translation
nodes). `lib/translator.ts` orchestrates providers: it serves a persisted
`target\ntext` cache (`localStorage`, LRU-bounded, written through with a
debounce), then walks `/api/llm/status` order (polled once) — `browser` entries
use the built-in `Translator` API locally, `openai` entries post
`/api/translate` — advancing on failure and throwing only when all fail.

Translation is **lazy**: `lib/translationQueue.ts` hands out queued block
indices in document order, and the reader enqueues only blocks within two
viewports of the visible area (`getBoundingClientRect` scan on a rAF-throttled
`scroll` listener, since an IntersectionObserver rooted at the parent frame does
not track in-iframe scrolling). A pump drains the queue in batches of 4 with a
cancel flag and per-document/session guards, showing `done/total` progress.
On load, all cached translations are restored instantly (no network); a partial
restore leaves the toggle on "翻译" so the user can fill the rest lazily.
Clicking a translation toggles it; the toggle is disabled with no provider.

### 13. AI assistant as an opencode agent

Reading questions are answered by a multi-turn agent that retrieves the paper's
own text **on demand** instead of answering from the model's memory.

- **Manager (`server/opencode.ts`)** — on boot, when `config.ai.enabled` (env
  `OPENCODE_ENABLED != 0`) and an `openai` provider exists,
  `OpencodeManager.start()` writes an isolated runtime dir
  `data/opencode-runtime/` (gitignored): `opencode.json` from
  `opencode-config.ts` plus `.opencode/tools/paper_search.ts` and
  `paper_section.ts` (one default export per file, so the tool name is the
  filename). It spawns `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port
  config.ai.port` with `cwd` = runtime dir and
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME`/`XDG_CACHE_HOME`/`XDG_STATE_HOME` all inside
  it — the spike showed the user's global agents/models/plugins leak in
  otherwise. `PAPER_API_BASE` + `PAPER_INTERNAL_TOKEN` are injected into the
  tool env. `GET /global/health` is polled up to 15s; the process is killed and
  the dir removed on SIGINT/SIGTERM; `isHealthy()` reflects readiness.
- **Config (`opencode-config.ts`)** — injects the first `openai` `LLM_PROVIDERS`
  entry as an `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` provider, and one agent `paper-tutor`
  with the model, `steps = AI_MAX_STEPS`, a system prompt that orders retrieval
  before answering, and `permission: deny` for
  `read/edit/glob/grep/list/bash/task/webfetch/websearch/lsp/skill/external_directory`
  (only our custom tools remain, so there is no shell/file surface).
- **Retrieval (`paper-content.ts` + `routes/paper.ts`)** — `paper-content.ts`
  fetches `arxiv.org/html/{id}`, extracts title/sections/paragraphs with Bun's
  `HTMLRewriter`, and caches them in `paper_content`/`paper_sections` with a
  `PAPER_CONTENT_TTL_HOURS` TTL (abstract fallback via `arxiv.ts` when HTML is
  missing). The tools call `GET /api/paper/session/:id/search?q=` (ranked
  paragraphs via `rankSections`) and `GET /api/paper/session/:id/section/:idx`
  (full section); both require `X-Internal-Token` (`internal-token.ts`) supplied
  from opencode's env.
- **Sessions (`ai-sessions.ts`)** — `POST /api/ai/session` maps an `arxivId` to
  a persistent opencode session in `ai_sessions` (created once, reused); opencode
  owns the message history.
- **Chat + streaming (`routes/ai.ts`, `ai-events.ts`)** — `POST /api/ai/chat`
  forwards `prompt_async(agent=paper-tutor, model, parts=[excerpt? + question +
  target language])` (the model must be in the body — the spike confirmed the
  global default otherwise leaks in). `GET /api/ai/stream?sessionId=` subscribes
  to opencode `/event`, filters to the session, and
  `ai-events.ts:normalizeOpencodeEvent` maps `message.part.delta` (append) →
  `delta` and `message.part.updated` (tool parts) → `tool`, ending on
  `session.idle` → `done`, relayed as SSE. `history` proxies
  `GET /session/:id/message`; `abort` proxies `POST /session/:id/abort`.
- **Frontend** — `components/AiAssistantPanel.tsx` renders the chat (message
  list, streaming bubble, tool chips, retry/stop) using
  `store/useAiChatStore.ts` for per-paper transcripts and `lib/aiChat.ts` for the
  reducer; `lib/aiAgent.ts` is the `/api/ai/*` client plus SSE reader. The reader
  bootstraps a session per paper and reloads history on mount.
- **Security posture** — the paper text is untrusted: the system prompt instructs
  the agent to ignore instructions found inside retrieved content
  (prompt-injection defense) and to answer only from retrieved text. The provider
  key lives only in the `0600` runtime config (never in the DB or sent to the
  client), `steps` caps cost, and unhealthy/missing opencode makes `/api/ai/*`
  return `503` while translation is unaffected.

### 14. Reading queue and progress

`lib/reading.ts` is a pure status map (`to_read`/`reading`/`done` + a clamped
progress percent); `store/useReadingStore.ts` persists it to
`localStorage['connectedpapers.reading.v1']`, consistent with notes. Entries are
keyed by paper id; the reader only knows the arXiv id, so the details-panel link
carries `?pid=<paperId>` and the reader keys on `pid ?? arxivId`. `PaperList`
shows a per-row status select + badge and a "仅看阅读清单" filter; `ReaderPage`
marks the paper `reading` on open (unless already `reading`/`done`) and writes a
throttled scroll percentage from an iframe `scroll` listener.

### 15. Reader highlights

A highlight anchors to `{ blockIndex, start, end }` (block order from
`collectBlocks`, character offsets within the block). `lib/highlights.ts` maps a
`Range` to/from an anchor, wraps each selected text segment in
`<mark data-hl-id>` (splitting text nodes, so ranges spanning inline elements
work), and unwraps on delete/clear. Because the marks preserve the block's text,
the stored offsets stay valid across reloads. `store/useHighlightsStore.ts`
persists `localStorage['connectedpapers.highlights.v1']` per reader key;
`ReaderPage` re-applies stored highlights on iframe load and shows a floating bar
for creating (colour + optional note) or editing (recolour/delete) them.

### 16. Search keyword history

`lib/searchHistory.ts` keeps a deduped, capped (20) recent-query list;
`store/useSearchHistoryStore.ts` persists it to
`localStorage['connectedpapers.searchHistory.v1']` with `record`/`remove`/`clear`.
`SearchBar` records on submit and shows a filtered dropdown on focus, where
clicking an item re-runs the search. Dropdown items use `onMouseDown`
preventDefault so the input keeps focus through the click.

### 17. Graph node context menu

Right-clicking a node opens `NodeContextMenu` (fixed-positioned, closes on
outside click / Escape / scroll) with actions on that paper: **以此为根重建网络**
(re-root the pane — primary via `selectRootPaper`, compare via `setComparePaper`;
the primary double-click rebuild reuses `graphAdapter.nodeToPaper`), **按标题搜索**
(`submitQuery` with the node title as a keyword query), **加入对比** (primary
only), and **打开原文** (when the node has a `url`). `NetworkGraph` wires
`onNodeRightClick`/`onBackgroundRightClick` in the shared props and suppresses the
browser menu via `onContextMenu` preventDefault, so it works in 2D and 3D.

### 18. Client-side network cache

Server builds are cached in `paper_networks` (24h), but the browser had no
persistent copy, so a refresh re-requested and re-ran the force layout.
`lib/networkCache.ts` adds a `localStorage` cache keyed like the server
(`${paperId}|d{depth}|n{maxNodes}`) holding the network data plus node `x/y/z`
positions, pruned to 8 entries by `savedAt` with a 7-day freshness TTL.
`usePaperNetwork` seeds React Query's `initialData` from it (fresh copy renders
instantly, no request, no loading flash) and writes results back; `NetworkGraph`
applies cached positions before rendering and saves positions on `onEngineStop`.
The server cache still backs the first build; this layer removes the repeat.

### 19. Multi-source related edges and canonical dedupe

Beyond citation BFS, `buildNetwork` adds: `related` edges from Semantic Scholar
recommendations (root, batched via `getPapersBatch`) and from OpenAlex
`related_works` (best-effort, resolved by DOI), plus `coupling` edges from
bibliographic coupling computed locally over the crawled reference sets
(`bibliographicCoupling`, kept when the shared-reference count reaches
`config.related.couplingMin`). Edge types are now
`reference | citation | related | coupling`, coloured via `EDGE_COLORS` and shown
in the legend. `identity.ts` gives each work a canonical key (DOI > arXiv >
provider id, DOI lowercased, arXiv version-stripped) and `mergeDuplicates`
collapses nodes that resolve to the same work (first id wins), repointing edges,
dropping self-loops and deduping edges by `from|to|type`. Node ids stay S2
paperIds so the `papers`/`citations` schema and routes are unchanged. Both caches
are invalidated by bumping `graphVersion` (server) / `NETWORK_GRAPH_VERSION`
(client).

### 20. Global relation persistence

`paper_relations(from_id, to_id, type, weight, source, updated_at)` (PK
`from,to,type`) stores every edge a build produces — reference/citation/related/
coupling — with a `source` tag (`s2` / `related` / `local`). `buildNetwork`
writes the merged edge list via `relations.ts:persistRelations` (best-effort), so
edges survive across sessions and future graphs can reuse them.
`GET /api/neighbors/:id` returns the stored relations touching an id plus the
`papers` rows for the involved ids; this is the read side that lazy expansion
(sub-project 4) consumes instead of re-crawling.

### 21. Lazy node expansion

Instead of crawling everything up front, right-clicking a node offers
**展开该节点**: `NetworkGraph` calls `api.networkWithPolling(nodeId, 1, 50)` and
merges the result into a local `extra` graph via `lib/graphMerge.ts`
(`mergeNetworkData` unions nodes by id and edges by `from|to|type`, keeping the
max weight). `extra` resets when the root/params change; filtering and encoding
run over `mergeNetworkData(networkData, extra)`, so expanded neighbours appear
immediately and the server-side cache persists the relations for next time. A
`展开中…` label reflects the in-flight request.

### 22. Relevance-prioritized expansion

The BFS no longer expands candidates in insertion order. As each level is
scanned, candidates are scored (`graph.ts:scoreCandidate`: `3 × linkCount` +
`log10(citations+1)` + a year-proximity bonus to the root) and the root's S2
recommendation ids form a priority tier. `rankCandidates` sorts priority ids
first, then by score, and only the top `s2BatchSize` are fetched, so the node
budget fills with the most relevant neighbours available at selection time. The
recommendation ids are fetched once per build (`safeRecommendationIds`) and
reused by `addRelatedNodes`. `graphVersion` / `NETWORK_GRAPH_VERSION` were bumped
to 4 to invalidate caches built with the old ordering.

### 23. Semantic neighbours (SPECTER2) + arXiv OpenAlex fallback

`paper_embeddings(id, model, vector, updated_at)` caches S2 SPECTER2 vectors
(`s2.ts:getEmbeddingsBatch`, single attempt — the endpoint is heavily
rate-limited). `buildNetwork` calls `addSemanticEdges` after merging: it reads
cached vectors for the node set, fetches a small batch of the missing ones
(best-effort, failures ignored), then `embeddings.ts:semanticNeighborEdges`
computes each node's top-k cosine neighbours above `embeddingMinSim` and adds
`semantic` edges (weight = similarity). The cache grows across builds, so
semantic coverage improves over time without hammering the API. Separately,
OpenAlex relatedness now falls back to a title search
(`getRelatedWorksForPaper`) because arXiv DOIs (`10.48550/arxiv.*`) 404 in
OpenAlex. Edge types are `reference | citation | related | coupling | semantic`
(coloured in `EDGE_COLORS`); `graphVersion`/`NETWORK_GRAPH_VERSION` bumped to 5.

### 24. Community detection (Louvain)

`community.ts:louvain` runs Louvain modularity local-moving (single level, good
for ≤300 nodes) over the weighted, undirected edge set and returns normalized
community ids. `buildNetwork` uses it for `clusterId` (replacing the plain
connected-component id, whose function remains exported), so cluster colouring
now reflects real communities. When the graph is coloured by cluster,
`NetworkGraph` fades edges that cross communities so they read as inter-cluster
links. `graphVersion`/`NETWORK_GRAPH_VERSION` bumped to 6.

### 25. Upstream rate limiting and keys

All Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex calls go through per-source limiters
(`rateLimit.ts:createLimiter`) that serialize requests with a minimum spacing —
`config.s2.minIntervalMs` (1000ms without a key, 100ms with one) and
`config.openalex.minIntervalMs` (200ms). Failures never break the chain, so
retries stay spaced. OpenAlex requests append `api_key` when `OPENALEX_API_KEY`
is set (alongside the existing polite-pool `mailto`), and S2 already sends
`x-api-key`. This keeps fan-out crawls under the shared rate limits instead of
bursting into 429s.

### 26. Library: favorites, collections, saved searches

`lib/library.ts` is a pure `Library` (`favorites: string[]`, `collections`,
`savedSearches`) with immutable operations; `store/useLibraryStore.ts` persists it
to `localStorage['connectedpapers.library.v1']`. `PaperList` shows a per-row star
plus "仅看收藏" and a collection filter; `DetailsPanel` has a favorite toggle and
an "加入集合" select (with 新建); `SearchBar` shows saved searches in its dropdown
with a 保存当前 action. Collections store paper ids (same key convention as the
reading list). Keys are not part of the graph, so no cache bump is involved.

### 27. Toggling edge types

`useUiStore.hiddenEdgeTypes: EdgeType[]` (with `toggleEdgeType`) drives edge
visibility. `NetworkGraph` drops hidden types right after `filterGraph`, and
`GraphLegend` renders each edge type as a button (coloured swatch, struck
through + dimmed when hidden) so the legend doubles as a filter. Hidden types are
session-only (not in the URL).

### 28. Timeline clarity

`GraphTimeline` now states its meaning directly: a "时间轴" title, a status badge
（`全部年份` or `≤ YYYY 年`）, the min/max year at the slider ends, and the hint
"仅显示该年份及更早发表的论文". Playback starts from the earliest year when idle
(`togglePlay`), so pressing play always has somewhere to go, and a "全部" button
clears the filter (replacing the bare ✕). When the root paper has a year inside
the visible range, the track is split at that year — blue 前置 (≤ root year) vs
green 后续 (> root year) with a marker — so the timeline reads as the paper's
own before/after.

### 29. Public deployment gate

`config.server.accessToken` (env `ACCESS_TOKEN`) turns on a single-token gate for
**all** requests when set (off by default, so local use is unchanged). `auth.ts`
extracts the token from `Authorization: Bearer`, `x-access-token`, the `cp_token`
cookie, or `?token=`, comparing it constant-time (`safeEqual`); a valid `?token=`
returns a 302 that sets an HttpOnly cookie (Secure behind TLS) and strips the
token from the URL. Over-limit `/api/*` requests are rejected 429 by a per-IP
fixed-window limiter (`rateLimit.ts:createRateLimiter`), using
`X-Forwarded-For` only when `TRUST_PROXY=1`. Deployment behind nginx with TLS and
systemd is documented in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` §5.

### 30. Predecessors & successors (lineage)

`POST /api/lineage` (`routes/lineage.ts`) answers "what came before / after this
paper?" directly, without a full graph crawl. `lineage.ts:fetchLineage` calls
S2's `/paper/{id}/references` and `/paper/{id}/citations` in parallel (each
best-effort; only both failing is an error) and `mapLineageEntries` ranks each
side — influential links first, then most-cited, then newest — deduped and capped
(`limit`, default 25, max 100). The response is
`{ root_id, prior: [...], followUps: [...] }`. In the UI, `DetailsPanel` shows a
研究脉络 section with clickable 前置工作（参考）/ 后续工作（引用） lists that select the
node in the graph, and `GraphLegend` labels the `reference`/`citation` edge types
accordingly; `NetworkGraph` keeps the root's own reference/citation edges fully
lit as a lineage cue.

## Data model

Schema in `server/schema.sql`; all tables `if not exists`, timestamps default to
`datetime('now')`.

- **`papers`** — primary entity. Primary key is `id` (set to the S2 paperId for
  S2-sourced rows); `doi`, `semantic_scholar_id`, `openalex_id` are unique.
  Stores metadata, denormalized
  `authors_text`, `fields_of_study` (JSON), `raw` S2 payload, and `fetched_at`.
  Indexed by doi / s2 / openalex / publication_year.
- **`authors`** — author identity (integer PK), optional `semantic_scholar_id`,
  h-index / counts, affiliations (JSON).
- **`paper_authors`** — join table (paper_id, author_id) with `author_position`;
  composite PK, cascade on delete.
- **`citations`** — directed edge (`citing_paper_id` → `cited_paper_id`),
  composite PK, `is_influential`, `contexts`, cascade on delete; indexed both ways.
- **`paper_networks`** — materialized graph cache keyed by `query_hash`, storing
  the serialized `network_data` plus `depth`, `max_nodes`, `graph_version`,
  node/edge counts, `generated_at`, `expires_at`.
- **`jobs`** — async work queue: `id` (uuid), `kind`, `payload` (JSON, includes
  `query_hash`), `status`, `attempts`, `progress` (JSON), `result_hash`, `error`.
- **`search_queries`** — append-only search log: query text/type, result count,
  execution time.
- **`paper_content`** — cached arXiv HTML extraction per `arxiv_id` (PK): title,
  `source`, `fetched_at`, `expires_at` (TTL).
- **`paper_sections`** — section rows (`arxiv_id`, `idx`) with `heading`/`text`,
  cascade-deleted with `paper_content`.
- **`ai_sessions`** — `arxiv_id` (PK) → `session_id` (unique) mapping for the
  per-paper opencode sessions, with `created_at`/`updated_at`.

## Known limitations & future work

- **No global citation graph persistence.** Citations are only stored for edges
  encountered while crawling a specific root; there is no repository-wide graph to
  query offline. A future version could persist all fetched edges and run global
  analytics.
- **Rendering is WebGL/canvas, not SVG.** The graph is drawn by `react-force-graph`
  (`ForceGraph2D` canvas for the default view, `ForceGraph3D` three.js loaded lazily
  for the 3D toggle), which stays interactive well past the configured caps
  (`maxNodes` default 200, route cap 300). The previous hand-written Canvas 2D
  renderer and custom WebWorker d3-force layout were removed in favor of the
  library's own simulation. The 3D bundle (~349 kB gzip) is code-split and only
  fetched on first 3D switch; the initial bundle carries the 2D renderer.
  `React.lazy` loads `ReaderPage` on demand, so it is not in the initial chunk.
  Manual vendor chunking was **removed**: splitting `react` from
  `react-force-graph` created a cross-chunk init order where `React.forwardRef`
  was undefined at run time (blank page). `chunkSizeWarningLimit` is raised to
  1400 for the intentionally lazy `three` chunk.
- **No authentication.** Acceptable while loopback-only; if the server is ever
  exposed beyond `127.0.0.1`, add auth and request limits.
- **Single-process job queue.** Jobs are in-process and persisted only as rows; a
  `running` job is resumed at boot but there is no concurrency control or worker
  pool.
- **Upstream rate limits.** Semantic Scholar throttling can truncate a crawl
  (partial graph) or fail a job; retries and batch delays mitigate but do not
  eliminate this.
- **Cache invalidation is coarse.** `graphVersion` invalidates all networks at
  once; per-parameter TTL tuning is not exposed to the client.
